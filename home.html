        Electronics have a profound impact on various aspects of modern society and culture, such as telecommunications, entertainment, education, health care, industry, and security12. Electronics plays a catalytic role in enhancing production and productivity in key sectors of the economy, whether it relates to infrastructure, process industries, communication, or even manpower training3. Since the invention of the transistor in the 1940s, electronics has advanced rapidly, providing a wide range of devices and technologies that have changed our daily lives in many ways2.
        branch of physics and electrical engineering that deals with the emission, behaviour, and effects of electrons and with electronic devices.

Electronics encompasses an exceptionally broad range of technology. The term originally was applied to the study of electron behaviour and movement, particularly as observed in the first electron tubes. It came to be used in its broader sense with advances in knowledge about the fundamental nature of electrons and about the way in which the motion of these particles could be utilized. Today many scientific and technical disciplines deal with different aspects of electronics. Research in these fields has led to the development of such key devices as transistors, integrated circuits, lasers, and optical fibres. These in turn have made it possible to manufacture a wide array of electronic consumer, industrial, and military products. Indeed, it can be said that the world is in the midst of an electronic revolution at least as significant as the industrial revolution of the 19th century.
